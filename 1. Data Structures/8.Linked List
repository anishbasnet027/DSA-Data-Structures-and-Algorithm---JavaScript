What is a Linked List?
A linked list is a linear data structure that stores a collection of data elements dynamically.
Nodes represent those data elements, and links or pointers connect each node.
Each node consists of two fields, the information stored in a linked list and a pointer that stores the address of its next node.
The last node contains null in its second field because it will point to no node.
A linked list can grow and shrink its size, as per the requirement.
It does not waste memory space.
Representation of a Linked List
This representation of a linked list depicts that each node consists of two fields. The first field consists of data, and the second field consists of pointers that point to another node.
