<h1>Stack</h1>
Sequential  Collection of elements that follows the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO).

Last element added in the stack will be removed first.

It is abstract data type. It is defined by its behavior rather than being a mathematical model.

It has two main operations 
    * Push, adds an elements to the Collection
    * Pop, removes the most recently added elements from the Collection

Example, Great to trace history, browser history, Undo operation in typing, Call stack in Javascript runtime

<h1>Stack Implementation</h1>
    * push()
    * pop()
    * peek() => get the value of the top element without removing it 
    * isEmpty() => check if the stack is empty
    * size() => get the number of elements in the stack 
    * print() => visualize the elements in the stack
