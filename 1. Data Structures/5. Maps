<h1>Map</h1>

A map is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Both keys and values can be of any data type.

To retrieve a value, you can use the corresponding key 

They are iterable, for loop


<h2>Object vs Map</h2>

Object are unordered, not iterable

keys in object can only be symbol or string, map can be of any type

object by deafult has own keys and may collide with user defined keys. But map dont have default keys

object can have functionality but map just store data
