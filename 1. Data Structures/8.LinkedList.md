What is a Linked List?
A linked list is a linear data structure that stores a collection of data elements dynamically.
Nodes represent those data elements, and links or pointers connect each node.
Each node consists of two fields, the information stored in a linked list and a pointer that stores the address of its next node.
The last node contains null in its second field because it will point to no node.
A linked list can grow and shrink its size, as per the requirement.
It does not waste memory space.
Representation of a Linked List
This representation of a linked list depicts that each node consists of two fields. The first field consists of data, and the second field consists of pointers that point to another node.

Types of Linked List
Following are the various types of linked list.

Simple Linked List − Item navigation is forward only.

Doubly Linked List − Items can be navigated forward and backward.

Circular Linked List − Last item contains link of the first element as next and the first element has a link to the last element as previous.
