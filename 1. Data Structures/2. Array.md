<h1>Array</h1>
<p>We use an Array to store the list of items in an ordered way. It can be num, string, obj, etc.
  
  Examples
  const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
  const cars = [
  "Saab",
  "Volvo",
  "BMW"
  ];
  arr = [];
  
  <h4>Arrays are Objects, Arrays are a special type of objects. The typeof operator in JavaScript returns "object" for arrays.</h4>
  
  <p>We can use index to access the elements in array.</p>
 
 <h2>Properties and Methods of an Array</h2>
 
 <h4>Length</h4>
 The length property of an array returns the length of an array (the number of array elements).
    Example
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
    let length = fruits.length;
               = 4
