Algorithmic complexity is a measure of how long an algorithm would take to complete given an input of size n. If an algorithm has to scale, it should compute the result within a finite and practical time bound even for large values of n. For this reason, complexity is calculated asymptotically as n approaches infinity. While complexity is usually in terms of time, sometimes complexity is also analyzed in terms of space, which translates to the algorithm's memory requirements.

Analysis of an algorithm's complexity is helpful when comparing algorithms or seeking improvements. Algorithmic complexity falls within a branch of theoretical computer science called computational complexity theory. It's important to note that we're concerned about the order of an algorithm's complexity, not the actual execution time in terms of milliseconds.

Algorithmic complexity is also called complexity or running time.
