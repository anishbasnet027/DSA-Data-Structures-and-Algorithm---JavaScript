What is Sorting?
A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list of elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of elements in the respective data structure.

For Example: The below list of characters is sorted in increasing order of their ASCII values. That is, the character with a lesser ASCII value will be placed first than the character with a higher ASCII value.

Different Sorting Algorithms
Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Quicksort
Counting Sort
Radix Sort
Bucket Sort
Heap Sort
Shell Sort
Complexity of Sorting Algorithms
The efficiency of any sorting algorithm is determined by the time complexity and space complexity of the algorithm.

1. Time Complexity: Time complexity refers to the time taken by an algorithm to complete its execution with respect to the size of the input. It can be represented in different forms:

Big-O notation (O)
Omega notation (Ω)
Theta notation (Θ)
2. Space Complexity: Space complexity refers to the total amount of memory used by the algorithm for a complete execution. It includes both the auxiliary memory and the input.

The auxiliary memory is the additional space occupied by the algorithm apart from the input data. Usually, auxiliary memory is considered for calculating the space complexity of an algorithm.
